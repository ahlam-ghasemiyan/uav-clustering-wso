🚁 UAV Clustering using White Shark Optimizer (WSO)
An energy-aware clustering framework for UAV networks powered by the White Shark Optimizer — a bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithm.


📖 Overview
This project implements an energy-efficient clustering scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks using the White Shark Optimizer (WSO) — a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm.

The algorithm selects an optimal subset of UAVs to act as Cluster Heads (CHs), minimizing a multi-objective fitness function that balances energy consumption, cluster density, and communication distance.

🎯 Goal: Prolong network lifetime and reduce communication overhead in UAV-assisted wireless networks.

🧠 Algorithms Used
🦈 White Shark Optimizer (WSO)
A bio-inspired metaheuristic that mimics the hunting behavior of great white sharks, combining:

Exploration — global search for optimal prey positions

Exploitation — refined movement near best solutions

Adaptive switching — balancing exploration vs. exploitation

Each shark represents a candidate set of Cluster Heads. The optimizer iteratively refines this set to minimize the fitness function.
